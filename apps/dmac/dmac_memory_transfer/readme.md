# DMAC memory transfer

This example application demonstrates how to use the DMAC peripheral to do a memory to memory transfer.

## Description

The application uses a software trigger to initiate a memory-memory transfer from the source buffer to the destination buffer with 16-bit beat size and 32-bit beat size. The number of cycles taken for the DMA transfer is measured using the System timer (SysTick) and reported on the console.

## Downloading and building the application

To download or clone this application from Github, go to the [top level of the repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_sam_ha1) and click

![clone](../../../docs/images/clone.png)

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/dmac/dmac_memory_transfer/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

| Project Name      | Description                                    |

### Setting up [SAM HA1G16A Xplained Pro](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/ATSAMHA1G16A-XPRO)

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
  - *NOTE:ATSAMHA1G16A device in SAM HA1G16A Xplained Pro board is not recommended for new design, hence replace the device with ATSAMHA1G16AB device. Connect the supported external debugger to Cortex Debug Port*

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the EDBG Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application using its IDE
4. LED indicates the success or failure:
    - LED is turned ON when the DMAC memory transfer is successful.
    - Following table provides the LED name

    | Board Name | LED Name |
    |------------| -------- |
    |[SAM HA1G16A Xplained Pro](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/ATSAMHA1G16A-XPRO) | LED0 |

5. Observe output message in console as follows:
