# SERCOM USART interrupt

This example application demonstrates how to use the SERCOM peripheral in USART mode to transfer data in a non-blocking manner.

## Description

This example shows the read and write operation over a UART in a non-blocking manner. The peripheral interrupt is used to manage the transfer. It receives 10 characters from the terminal window and echoes them back.

## Downloading and building the application

### Setting up [SAM HA1G16A Xplained Pro](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/ATSAMHA1G16A-XPRO)

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

### Note:
*ATSAMHA1G16A device in SAM HA1G16A Xplained Pro board is not recommended for new design, hence replace the device with ATSAMHA1G16AB device. Connect the supported external debugger to Cortex Debug Port*

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the EDBG Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application using its IDE
4. The console displays the following message

5. Type 10 characters in the console
6. Entered characters will be echoed back and the LED is toggled
7. The following table provides the LED names

| Board      | LED Name                                    |
