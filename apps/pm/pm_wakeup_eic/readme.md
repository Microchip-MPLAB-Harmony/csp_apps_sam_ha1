# PM wakeup using EIC

This application demonstrates entering the low power modes and exiting it using the EIC.

## Description

The PM peripheral library is used to enter the low power mode and the device exits low power mode when the button is pressed. To identify a button push, the EIC is configured to detect a falling edge on the GPIO pin connected to the switch.

### Setting up [SAM HA1G16A Xplained Pro](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/ATSAMHA1G16A-XPRO)

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

### Note:
*ATSAMHA1G16A device in SAM HA1G16A Xplained Pro board is not recommended for new design, hence replace the device with ATSAMHA1G16AB device. Connect the supported external debugger to Cortex Debug Port*

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the EDBG Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application using its IDE
4. LED is blinked continuously using the SysTick Timer
5. The console displays the following message
