# NVMCTRL read write

This example application demonstrates how to use the NVMCTRL to erase and program the internal Flash memory.

## Description

This example uses the NVMCTRL peripheral library to erase a row and write an array of values to the internal Flash memory. It verifies the value written by reading the values back and comparing it to the value written.

## Downloading and building the application

To download or clone this application from Github, go to the [top level of the repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_sam_ha1) and click

### Setting up [SAM HA1G16A Xplained Pro](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/ATSAMHA1G16A-XPRO)

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

### Note:
*ATSAMHA1G16A device in SAM HA1G16A Xplained Pro board is not recommended for new design, hence replace the device with ATSAMHA1G16AB device. Connect the supported external debugger to Cortex Debug Port*

## Running the Application

1. Build and Program the application using its IDE
2. The LED indicates the success or failure:
    - LED is turned ON when the value read from the flash memory matched with the written value
    - LED is turned OFF when the value read from the flash memory did not match with the written value
3. The following table provides the LED name:

| Board      | LED Name |
| ---------- | ---------|
| [SAM HA1G16A Xplained Pro](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/ATSAMHA1G16A-XPRO) | LED0 |
