# PORT polling

This example application demonstrate how to poll the switch input, and indicate the switch status using the LED.

## Description

This application uses the PORT Peripheral library to read the GPIO pin connected to the switch, and drives the GPIO pin connected to the LED to indicate the switch status. LED is turned ON when the switch is pressed and turned OFF when the switch is released.

## Downloading and building the application

To download or clone this application from Github, go to the [top level of the repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_sam_ha1) and click

### Setting up [SAM HA1G16A Xplained Pro](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/ATSAMHA1G16A-XPRO)

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

### Note:
*ATSAMHA1G16A device in SAM HA1G16A Xplained Pro board is not recommended for new design, hence replace the device with ATSAMHA1G16AB device. Connect the supported external debugger to Cortex Debug Port*

## Running the Application

1. Build and Program the application using its IDE
2. LED is turned on when the switch is pressed and turned off when the switch is released.
