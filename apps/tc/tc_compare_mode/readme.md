# TC compare mode

This example shows how to use the TC module in compare mode to generate an active low, active high, and toggle output on compare match.

## Description

Three TC channels are configured in compare mode. Each channel generates different output waveform depending upon configured action on compare match and period match.

**Active low output**: Output is set high on compare 1 match and is
set low on compare 0 match.

**Active high output**: Output is set low on compare 1 match and is
set high on compare 0 match.

**Toggle output**: Output toggles on compare 0 match.

### Setting up [SAM HA1G16A Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/ATSAMHA1G16A-XPRO)

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

### Note:
*ATSAMHA1G16A device in SAM HA1G16A Xplained Pro board is not recommended for new design, hence replace the device with ATSAMHA1G16AB device. Connect the supported external debugger to Cortex Debug Port*

## Running the Application

1. Build and Program the application using its IDE
2. Observe generated waveforms on the oscilloscope
